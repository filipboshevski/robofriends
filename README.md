## RoboFriends Made by Filip Boshevski

RoboFriends is an API-powered web application which introduces API Database Filtering using a fun concept with robots and names. The app is connected to an outside API which provides the app with the desired data, which the app then processes and displays individual robot using JavaScript. It's fun to see such simple concepts evolve in a multi-level project like Facebook and other web apps using only JavaScript with React.js.
